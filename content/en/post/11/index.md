This week, as a computer science student, I experienced a series of interesting and eventful moments. Monday started with a lecture on graph theory, where we studied search and optimization algorithms for graphs. In the evening, I spent time finishing a Java lab, implementing data processing algorithms.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, I was actively working on a mobile app development project. My team and I integrated APIs and tested the user interface. These days also involved many meetings to discuss new ideas and refine functionality.

On Thursday, we had a seminar on artificial intelligence, where we analyzed examples of neural networks and machine learning applications. I also spent time exploring new libraries and tools for future projects.

Over the weekend, I decided to take a break from studying and spend time outdoors. On Saturday, I took a walk around the city and visited a technology exhibition, while Sunday was dedicated to reading books and preparing for upcoming exams, readying myself for the challenges of the next week.
