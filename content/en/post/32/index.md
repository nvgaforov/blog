The past week was quite eventful. Monday began with a lecture on computational systems, where we studied the architecture of modern processors and their optimization. After the lectures, I focused on a lab project in systems programming, where I created my own version of a file system.

On Tuesday, I delved into machine learning algorithms during a practical session. We worked on a data classification project, applying different models and evaluating their effectiveness. On Wednesday, I continued improving the project, fine-tuning algorithms and adjusting the models' hyperparameters.

Thursday was dedicated to preparing for a seminar on cryptography. I studied modern encryption methods and their applications, preparing a report for discussion. On Friday, I spent time in a consultation with my professor to clarify some questions that came up during my preparation.

Over the weekend, I decided to take a break from academic work. On Saturday, I went to the movies with friends, and on Sunday, I spent the day reading books about new technologies and planning my next steps in my studies. It was a great way to relax and prepare for the upcoming week.
