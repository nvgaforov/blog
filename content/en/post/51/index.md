This week, as a computer science student, I spent my time quite productively. Monday started with a lecture on mobile app development, where we studied the basics of working with APIs and integrating external services. After class, I immersed myself in a project to create a simple mobile app, adding new features and fixing bugs.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, I worked on research related to machine learning. My team and I analyzed datasets, trained models, and compared their results. On Wednesday evening, I attended a seminar on optimization algorithms, where I learned about new methods to improve computational processes.

Thursday was dedicated to preparing for an exam on algorithm theory. I reviewed the main sorting and search algorithms, solved practical problems, and tested my knowledge. On Friday, I completed the development of modules for a web programming lab, where we created user interaction interfaces.

During the weekend, I decided to relax and recharge. On Saturday, I went on a tour of local attractions, and on Sunday, I spent time reading books and planning future projects to be ready for new challenges in the upcoming week.
