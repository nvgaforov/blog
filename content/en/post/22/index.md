The past week was both busy and productive. On Monday, I began with a lecture on software engineering, where we studied the principles of software architecture design. After classes, I worked on an assignment for object-oriented programming, implementing complex data structures.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, I focused on working on a web development project. My team and I integrated new features and tested the interface, which took a lot of time and effort. On Wednesday evening, I attended a data analysis seminar where we discussed machine learning methods and their applications to real-world tasks.

Thursday was dedicated to preparing for an exam on database management systems. I spent time studying complex queries and practicing database creation and optimization. By Friday, I had completed the project and presented it in an internal review.

Over the weekend, I decided to relax and have some fun. On Saturday, I went to the gym and had dinner with friends, while Sunday was spent reading academic articles and preparing for the upcoming week to be ready for new academic challenges.
