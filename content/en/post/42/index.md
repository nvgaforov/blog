The past week was full of activity and interesting tasks. On Monday, I attended a lecture on databases, where we delved into the topic of indexing and query optimization. After the lecture, I spent time working on a lab assignment related to creating and managing relational databases.

On Tuesday, I worked on a game development project. My team and I were programming the game engine and testing new mechanics. Throughout the week, I also attended a practical session on network programming, where we studied network configuration and security.

On Thursday, I focused on preparing for the exam on operating systems. I reviewed key topics such as memory management and multitasking. On Friday, I finished working on a software development project and presented it during a defense at the university.

I spent the weekend productively. On Saturday, I met up with friends for a walk around the city and enjoyed the fresh air. On Sunday, I dedicated time to self-education, studying new trends in artificial intelligence and watching educational videos. It was a great end to the week and a preparation for the new challenges ahead.
